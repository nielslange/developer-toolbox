# Arrays

An array is a linear data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, rather than declaring separate variables for each value.

In most programming languages, including TypeScript, arrays are zero-based, meaning that the first element of the array has an index of 0. You can access the elements of an array using their indices, which start at 0 for the first element and increment by 1 for each subsequent element.

### Example in TypeScript

```typescript
let array: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let array: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```
